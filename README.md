A project featuring Deep Learning based Facial Action Control in an Android game. When I was brainstorming about the game choice, I got the idea of implementing a knife/dagger throwing game. It is easy enough to play, allowing more possibilities on facial control.

I found an already developed version of this game on YouTube with free source code. Unluckily, the source code was written in Java and was not clean and tidy enough for newbies like me to understand. As I'm required to use Kotlin Jetpack Compose to write this game, I have decided to re-develop the game on my own. 

I used some image rosources from the source code (free without license) along with mine, did modifications to the UI, and completely written all the game logics on my own. By the end, I successfully re-developed the game.

# Project Information
- Title: Deep Learning based Facial Action Control Mobile Game (Android Version)
- Field: Artificial intelligence and expert systems/Mobile App, AI

# Project Description
The main objective of this project is to use deep-learning-based computer vision technology to develop a facial action control smartphone game that can promote facial muscle exercise to reduce the aging process of the face. We will first study which types of facial movements (such as eye blinking, smiling mouth, panicking mouth, etc.) are suitable for mobile game control, and then use deep learning methods to realize this facial movement recognition. The second phase of the project is to use these facial motion recognition algorithms as the main controls for simple 2D mobile games (such as shooting games, cannon games, flying birds, etc.) for Android and iOS platforms. We believe that this project has the potential to create a new type of mobile game and bring a new user experience in terms of playing games.
